## 🎮 Architecture Overview

### Modular Design
The application follows a clean modular architecture with separated concerns:

#### **GameController** (game-controller.js)
- Main orchestrator that manages all other modules
- Handles game lifecycle and state management
- Coordinates between UI, networking, and game logic

#### **NetworkManager** (network.js)
- Manages Socket.io connection and real-time communication
- Handles lobby system and player management
- Abstracts networking layer from game logic

#### **BoardManager** (board.js)
- Manages the game board state and tile placement
- Handles drag & drop functionality
- Synchronizes board state across players

#### **GameLogic** (game-logic.js)
- Implements Scrabble rules and validation
- Word finding algorithms and scoring calculations
- Dictionary API integration for word validation

#### **UIManager** (ui.js)
- Handles all user interface interactions
- Manages drag & drop events and button states
- Controls visual feedback and game displays

#### **NetworkPlayer** (player.js)
- Represents individual players in the game
- Manages player racks, scores, and state
- Handles both local and remote player interactions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Server-Side (server.js)
- Express.js web server
- Socket.io real-time communication
- Authoritative game state management
- Player connection handling
- Tile bag management and distribution

### Client-Side Architecture
- ES6 modules for clean code organization
- Event-driven architecture with custom events
- Separation of concerns (UI, logic, networking)
- Reactive state management
- Error handling and offline mode support

### Networking Protocol
- Server maintains authoritative game state
- Client actions are validated server-side
- Real-time synchronization of:
  - Board state
  - Player scores
  - Turn progression
  - Tile placements

## 🎯 Game Rules Implemented

1. **First Word**: Must pass through center star (H8)
2. **Word Formation**: All tiles must form valid words
3. **Connectivity**: New words must connect to existing words
4. **Straight Lines**: Tiles must be placed in rows or columns
5. **No Gaps**: Continuous tile placement required
6. **Dictionary Validation**: Real-time word checking
7. **Scoring**: Premium squares, letter values, word multipliers
8. **Turn Management**: Sequential player turns with pass option

## 📁 Assets Organization

The `assets/` folder is prepared for future enhancements:

### `/assets/textures/`
- Future: Custom board backgrounds
- Future: Tile designs and animations
- Future: UI element customizations

### `/assets/sounds/`
- Future: Tile placement sounds
- Future: Word validation feedback
- Future: Background music and effects

## 🔧 Development

### Running the Game
```bash
npm start
```

### File Dependencies
- All JavaScript files use ES6 modules
- Clear import/export structure
- Minimal coupling between modules
- Easy to test and maintain

### Code Quality
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging and debugging
- Professional code organization

## 🎨 Styling

### CSS Organization
- Single consolidated CSS file in `/css/`
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Custom styles for game-specific elements
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface
- Intuitive drag & drop interactions
- Clear visual feedback
- Professional game board appearance

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The modular architecture makes it easy to add:
- Custom board themes and tile designs
- Sound effects and music
- AI players with different difficulty levels
- Tournament and scoring systems
- Save/load game functionality
- Mobile touch interface optimization
- Spectator mode for watching games

## 📝 Code Maintenance

Each module is self-contained and can be:
- Unit tested independently
- Modified without affecting other modules
- Extended with new features easily
- Debugged in isolation

This professional structure ensures long-term maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.
